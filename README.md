I created these scripts during my free trial of Google's IT Automation with Python cert. Wanted to finish during the trial, and got pretty far. Still proud of these scripts!

I didn't want to limit the use cases of the prompted projects to what was being asked in the course, so I tweaked them to be of general use. 
Some are still under construction, but you can get an idea of their functionality and my coding style here.
